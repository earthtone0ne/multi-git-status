Multi-git-status
================

Show uncommited, untracked and unpushed changes in multiple Git repositories.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fboender/multi-git-status/master/screenshot.png)

multi-git-status shows:

* **Branch names** Displays the checked-out branch name, if it is not master.
* **Uncommitted changes** if there are unstaged or uncommitted changes on the
  checked-out branch.
* **Untracked files** if there are untracked files which are not ignored.
* **Needs push (BRANCH)** if the branch is tracking a (remote) branch which is
  behind.
* **Needs upstream (BRANCH)** if a branch does not have a local or remote
  upstream branch configured. Changes in the branch may otherwise never be
  pushed or merged.
* **Needs pull (BRANCH)** if the branch is tracking a (remote) branch which is
  ahead. This requires that the local git repo already knows about the remote
  changes (i.e. you've done a `fetch`), or that you specify the `-f` option.
  Multi-git-status does NOT contact the remote by default.
* **X stashes** if there are stashes.

Since there are a lot of different states a git repository can be in,
multi-git-status makes no guarantees that *all* states are taken into account.

multi-git-status can also list dirs that are not a repo, if given the `-w`
switch.


# Usage

    Usage: mgitstatus [-w] [-e] [-f] [--no-X] [DIR] [DEPTH=2]

    Scan for .git dirs under DIR (up to DEPTH dirs deep) and show git status

      -w   Warn about dirs that are not Git repositories
      -e   Exclude repos that are 'ok'
      -f   Do a 'git fetch' on each repo (slow for many repos)

    You can limit output with the following options:

      --no-push
      --no-pull
      --no-upstream
      --no-uncommitted
      --no-untracked
      --no-stashes

The following example scans all directories under the current dir, with a
depth of 2. That means the current dir and all directories directly under it.

    ~/Projects/fboender $ mgitstatus 
    ./multi-git-status: ok 
    ./mdpreview: ok 
    ./snippets: ok 
    ./boxes: ok 
    ./ansible-cmdb: Uncommitted changes Untracked files 
    ./scriptform: Uncommitted changes 

To scan deeper:

    ~/Projects $ mgitstatus . 3
    ./megacorp/ansible: ok 
    ./megacorp/monitoring: ok 
    ./fboender/multi-git-status: ok 
    ./fboender/mdpreview: ok 
    ./fboender/snippets: ok 
    ./fboender/boxes: ok 
    ./fboender/ansible-cmdb: Uncommitted changes Untracked files 
    ./fboender/scriptform: Uncommitted changes 
    ./fboender/startpage: ok
